		    		Ethernet over Copper / Metro Ethernet or EoC is a product that is quickly replacing T1 circuits wherever it is available. T1 still reigns supreme in the category of coverage, but EoC is about half the cost of T1 circuits for the same bandwidth. With speeds from 2mbps x 2mbps to 20mbps x 20mbps, EoC is a high end, high-uptime, copper-based product with a business SLA of 99.999% for mission critical applications. Customers who are under contract with existing EoC circuits, but need more bandwidth, still have options with our fiber-fusion technology. Call us today even if you’re under contract.

		    		We can deliver business grade ADSL products with a static ip, business-class service level agreement and our outstanding customer service. This is good for very small businesses or businesses that do not require the advantages of the other circuits. We also have long range ADSL2 products that can reach areas where normal phone company DSL is not available. In addition, we offer SDSL products. While it is more expensive and does not supply the higher data rates of ADSL, it does offer a longer range solution in situations where nothing else is available.

On our scalable circuits, bandwidth can be turned up in 4 hours or less.  We guarantee the lowest price on all fiber circuits and bandwidth. Our fiber prices have beaten AT&T, Verizon and other Fiber Carriers by as much as 50% on high bandwidth circuits! Contact us today even if you’re in contract.

		    		Our wireless Ethernet products are an amazing alternative to Ethernet over Copper (EoC), T1, Bonded T1 and Ethernet over Copper. While EoC is about 50% the cost of T1 for higher bandwidth applications W-Ethernet products deliver the same SLA, low latency and the high speeds of EoC with about 15-20% lower costs on average. Repair times are faster, if ever needed, on W-Ethernet products. Our W-Ethernet products are completely within our own network and all business backbones feature a routed network with full redundancy. W-Ethernet offers quick scalability in .5mbps increments and options, like bandwidth bursting, that can be enabled in minutes. Our coverage areas are Orange County, Los Angeles County, Ventura County, Simi Valley, Santa Barbara County, and Parts of Kern County in Southern California.
